Hi! I’m Yilin He (何奕霖) A first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Macau with an interdisciplinary background spanning sociology, educational technology, and computer science. 

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a UX Researcher at Alibaba, serving in the advertising system. I then joined an Edutech startup as an AI Product Manager, where I explored how large language models can be applied to generate educational resources and enhance learning experiences. In addition, I designed and delivered nonprofit AI lectures and workshops reaching more than 1,000 K–12 teachers, helping them gain hands-on experience with AI literacy and agent applications.

My research now focuses on HRI. To be specific, that is  understanding complex human intentions and emotions—both verbal and nonverbal—across cultures, and on developing systems that can recognize these signals to provide more meaningful and human-centered responses.

PS: I always welcome collaborations in human–agent interaction research, AI product Devlopment, and  AI Literacy Programs. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect! My email is lysandreho@163.com
