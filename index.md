Here is **Hanlin Cai (Lance, 蔡翰林)**.

I am a graduate student in the Internet of Everything Group at the University of Cambridge, supervised by Prof. Ozgur Akan and Dr. Kai Li, and funded by the Cambridge Trust and CSC Scholarships. I also had the pleasure of participating in a summer research program with Prof. Pietro Liò at the Artificial Intelligence Group.

Prior to Cambridge, I have worked on wireless networks and cybersecurity under the guidance of Prof. Zhezhuang Xu and Dr. Meng Yuan. Besides, I was honored to be selected as an Undergraduate Scholar at the leading conferences AAAI 2024 and SIGKDD 2024.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and academic collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at — **hc663@cam.ac.uk**
